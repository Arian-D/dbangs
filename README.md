## dbangs
### What
dbangs is a CLI tool to search various websites, similar to DuckDuckGo's bangs.
### Why
It requires less typing, is fast, and does not have to send requests to DuckDuckGo every time you search.
### How
The syntax is as follows:
```
b <bang> <query>
```
For example, to search something on DuckDuckGo:
```
b d something
```
To search for an interesting article on Wikipedia:
```
b w interesting article
```

git clone https://github.com/Arian-D/dbangs
